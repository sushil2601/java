Exceptions are of two types
---------------------------

1. Unchecked exceptions are those exception which may or may not be handled. If we don't handle such exceptions, compiler will not generate any error.

e.g. ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc.

2. Checked exceptions are those exception which MUST be handled otherwise compiler will generate error.

e.g. ClassNotFoundException
