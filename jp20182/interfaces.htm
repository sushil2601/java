<p>Write a program to create an interface <span class="style5">RaisedToPower</span> that defines a function <br>
  <span class="style2">void toThePower(int k);</span><br>
  Define two classes<span class="style3"> Square</span> and<span class="style3"> Cube</span> that implements <span class="style6">RaisedToPower</span> interface.<br>

<hr>
<p>In Industry forcasts its sales by considering the sales of last three years. It uses two methods<br>
  1. Simple Average<br>
  2. Weighted Average<br>
  In the 1st method, forcast is given by <br>
  E=(X1+X2+X3)/3<br>
  In the 2nd method, the expected sales in the coming year is assumed to be<br>
  E=0.2X3+0.3X2+0.5X1<br>
  <br>
  where Xk is the sales k years before the current year.<br>
  The sales during the last years were 400 480 and 450.Write a program to forecast the sales of the coming year.<br>
  Use two classes 
implementing the same interface to forecast the sales. </p>
