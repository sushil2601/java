Packages are used to classify class files in JAVA.

In order to make class file member of a package, we must write following statement on the top of JAVA file

package pkg1;

where pkg1 is name of the package

Once class becomes member of the package then class can only be accessed with package name.

e.g. if class name is test1 and package name is pkg1 then class file must be accessed as follows

pkg1.test1

When we try to access class belonged to a package then JAVA will try to find folder of same name as that of package at classpath and then find class file in the folder.
