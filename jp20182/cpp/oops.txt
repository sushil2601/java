OOPS
----

Class is a specification which specifies that how its objects will look like and how they will behave.

Object is an instance of class

--------------------------------------------------------------

Principles of OOPS
------------------
1. Encapsulation is  process of binding data and code together in a class.

2. Inheritance is process of creating new classes by extending existing classes with new features.

  Marker "is a" Pen
  Exhaust fan is a fan
  Mobile is a phone
  Smart phone is a mobile
  Student is a person
  
3. Polymorphism

One name multiple implementations


4. Abstraction

Managing complexities of object by provising simple interface to the user.

Data abstraction says that data should be made hidden from the user and should be accessed through function.

-------------------------------------------------

If class has more than one function with same name and different set of arguments then it is known as function overloading.
In case of function overloading, function call is invoked based upon arguments.

Function overloading is an implementation of polymorphism.
------------------------

Constructor
-----------
1. is called when object is created.
2. has same name as that of class
3. may or may not have arguments. Constructor without argument is known as default constructor and with arguments is known as parameterrized constructor.
4. constructor does not have any return type not even void.
5. purpose of constructor is to initialize object when it created.
6. if a class has multiple constructors then it is known as constructor overloading.
