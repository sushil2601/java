Array in Java
-------------

1) Array is always dynamic or allocated at runtime.
2) Array may be of Zero Length.
3) Array elements are not initialized with Garbage values by default. Array of numeric data is always initialized with ZERO and Array of objects is always initialized with NULL, by default.


4) Array is treated as an Object which has an additional property "length" which stores size of array.

5) If array is tried to be accessed outside its range, a runtime error "ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException" is generated.
