Interface
---------
is an essentially abstract class

All data members of interface are essentially final.
All function members of interface are essentially abstract.

Interface can be inherited by any class using "implements" keyword

More than one interfaces may be inherited by a class, so multiple inheritance is supported through interfaces in Java.
