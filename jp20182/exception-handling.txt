Exception is runtime error thrown by JVM.

Whenever some exception occurs, JVM generates an object of Exception or its sub class and throws a message. This message is not user friendly message and can only be understood by developer.
Also, when exception occurs, program terminates immidiately.

So to prevent termination of program & to generate user friendly message, we need to handle exception.

Exception handling is done by enclosing statements in try block followed by catch block.

So, whenever exception will occur in statements enclosed in try block, control will jump to respective catch block and program will not terminate.
